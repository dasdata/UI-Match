# UI-Match

This is the Interface of the Interfaces. Know what you have to build before you even start any development! 
The UI-Match (or "Interface Matchmaker") is a console application that helps users identify the best interface for their needs based on their preferences and priorities.

## Installation

To run the application, simply download the source code and compile it using a C# compiler. The application has been tested on Windows and Linux platforms.

## Usage

To use the application, run the executable file and follow the prompts. The application will ask you to rate the importance of various criteria (such as ease of use, speed, and customizability) and to rate different interfaces on a scale of 1-3 based on how well they meet those criteria. The application will then calculate a weighted score for each interface and provide a recommendation based on your preferences.
